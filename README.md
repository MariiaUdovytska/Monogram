# Project Overview

This project was conceived as a practice ground to hone my programming skills, inspired by the website https://monogramcc.com/, which was suggested on https://www.frontendpractice.com/. Developed using React, TypeScript, React Bootstrap, and SCSS, this project adopts a Single Page Application (SPA) approach, showcasing a commitment to modern web development practices. It leverages React's powerful features, including useContext, useState, useEffect, and ReactNode, to manage state and lifecycle events efficiently.

## Features

- **Shop Page**: A fully functional shop page where users can browse through products, offering a seamless shopping experience.
- **Product Page**: By clicking on any product, users are directed to a detailed product page identified by its ID, enhancing the user's journey by providing in-depth information about each product.
- **Advanced Local Storage Logic**: The project goes beyond basic functionalities, incorporating a series of sophisticated functions within the `LocalStorage` component. These functionalities ensure a comprehensive handling of the shopping cart operations, including adding, updating, and removing products. Additionally, logic has been implemented for rendering product ratings with stars in reviews, showcasing the project's functionality and user interface design.

## Data Handling

In the absence of server-side information, JSON files for products and reviews are utilized as a realistic substitute for fetching data from a server. This approach demonstrates the project's ability to work with data structures and simulate dynamic content delivery.

## Future Plans

The project is structured to allow for future expansions. Plans include developing the main page further and adding other pages, thereby broadening the site's functionality and enriching the user experience. This foundational work lays the groundwork for continued growth, with the potential to introduce more complex features and optimizations to further elevate the overall functionality.
